I pondered the advice I could give to young women entering the workplace and those feeling the corporate frustration of stagnation in a patriarchal society, writes Haseena Cassim. Looking back on my own journey, I’ve unpacked the key moments that cemented my path to where I am today. I matriculated with ambitions of being a graduate, but not a cent to my name. A few years later I was an LLB graduate working as an article clerk with the title of PA. Throughout this 10-year period, through a tonne of naysayers and those who said I would amount to nothing or that I was insane to be making tea after spending years of sacrifice to become a lawyer, I learned some lessons. Rise, young queens. ~ Haseena Cassim is managing director at YFM. Want to continue this conversation on The Media Online platforms? Comment on Twitter @MediaTMO or on our Facebook page.
