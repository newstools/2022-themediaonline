[PRESS OFFICE] Vote for your favourite radio station and stand a chance to win R40 000. The Radio Awards MyStation Competition is officially open, and we call on listeners to show their favourite South African radio station some love by voting for them online via the competition web page.  There is no limit on the number of votes they may cast. By voting, listeners are automatically entered into a lucky draw where they stand the chance to win R40 000 cash prize. The competition closes on 24 June 2022. The public votes from the MyStation Competition determine the station winners of two separate MyStation Awards: Most Votes for the station that receives the highest number of online votes; Most Loyal Listener award for the station that earns the most votes as a ratio against their listenership. Listeners can join the conversation using #MyStationCompetition and #SARadioAwards, and tune in for the latest updates and news on social media by following @SARadioAwards on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.
